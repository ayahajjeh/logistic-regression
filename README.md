# Logistic Regression, Cross Entropy Cost, Perceptron Cost, and Evaluation Metrics
`This was one of my projects for CS74 Machine Learning class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, I implement several logistic regression models using two cost functions: the cross entropy cost function and the softmax perceptron cost function. I plot the cost history against the iteration step number to compare the two cost functions using the same data set and training model. I also evaluate the different models using metrics such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, ROC curve, and ROC AUC score.
